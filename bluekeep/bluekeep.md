#What is BlueKeep
BlueKeep is the colloquial name for [CVE-2019-0708](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0708), first coined by security researcher [Kevin Beaumont](https://twitter.com/gossithedog). 

It is a vulnerability in the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) component of Microsoft Windows operating systems.

#How dangerous is it? 
*Correct as of 23/05/2019*

The BlueKeep vulnerability is rated with a Common Vulnerabilities Scoring System (CVSS) score of [9.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-0708#vulnCurrentDescriptionTitle). Out of 10. In other words, this is rated as a Critical vulnerability. 

This is scored on the difficulty to exploit, as well as the impact an attacker could have if they exploited the vulnerability. According to Microsoft and NVD, an attacker who exploited this vulnerability would have complete access to a system, which could lead to complete loss of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. 

#Does an exploit exist for it?
The good news at the moment is that no public exploit exists[1](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/An+Update+on+the+Microsoft+Windows+RDP+%22Bluekeep%22+Vulnerability+%28CVE-2019-0708%29+%5Bnow+with+pcaps%5D/24960). This means that for an unskilled, or averagely skilled attacker, they cannot currently exploit this vulnerability. It isn't beyond the realms of possibility however that an advanced attacker, such as government sponsored groups, or commercial exploit developers have a working exploit. 

Currently, a number of [detection scripts exist](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/11869), which simply check whether a machine is susceptible to the vulnerability. Additionally, a number of parties have published fake and malicious exploits, which either do not work, or damage the computer of the person trying to run the exploit. 

Various parties are actively trying to create a working exploit, therefore it is only a matter of time until one exists.

Should a public exploit become widely available, this page will be updated.

#What's the worst that could happen?
If a working exploit were published tomorrow, attackers would potentially be able to attack a large number of machines, or even turn this vulnerability into a worm, similar to how the [WannaCry ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack) was spread. 

#What can I do to protect myself?
Patch now. Luckily, Microsoft published the patches for this vulnerability before it was widely known, in a process called responsible disclosure. These patches should be deployed automatically if you have Windows Update turned on. 

For older systems, such as XP and Server 2003, although these operating systems are out-of-support, Microsoft rated the vulnerability so dangerous that they took the unusual step of producing patches for these operating systems too. 

The details for all patches can be found here: https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0708

If for whatever reason you cannot patch, turning off port 3389 (RDP) would protect you from the vulnerability, as this is the service that is vulnerable. Especially turn off port 3389 on any internet facing devices and use [Shodan](https://shodan.io) to ensure that no port 3389 devices exist in your internet facing ranges, with the search term:

``net:192.168.1.1/24 port:3389``

Where 192.168.1.1/24 is replaced with your network range. NB, this requires you to be logged in to Shodan.
